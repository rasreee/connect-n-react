          The end goal is to create a playable React connect-four. But, one fun
          wrinkle: this is actually <strong>Connect N</strong>. The player
          should have the option to play on a board of any dimensions and decide
          how many in a row constitutes a win.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application already provides a very modest onboarding flow for the
          game (please feel free to modify or improve this as needed, but I
          would advise not to spend time up-front on this):
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Ask for player names</li>
          <li>
            Ask for board dimensions (default are the classic Connect 4
            dimensions, 7 columns x 6 rows)
          </li>
          <li>Ask for how many in a row to win (default is 4)</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Your objective is to use this information to:</strong>

        <ol>
          <li>Start the game.</li>
          <li>Build a Connect-4 board with the User's preferred dimensions.</li>
          <li>
            Alternate turns: Player 1 drops a piece, player 2 drops a piece,
            etc... until a win or a draw.
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>Calculate a win:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A win occurs when either player has x number of pieces in a row
                in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
              </li>
              <li>A draw occurs when there are no spots remaining.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <strong>How to Build It</strong>

        <p>
          We've attempted to ease this challenge by making it directed, so it's
          suggested you follow the steps below to completion. You can search the
          project for your next action item by looking for a comment containing{' '}
          <pre style={{ display: 'inline' }}>TODO(#)</pre> where # is the step.
        </p>

        <p>
          You shouldn't need to important any additional libraries, but feel
          free if you so choose to.

                Use your creativity here and try to make it look as great as you
                can! Although this doesn't affect the functionality of the game,
                this section is as important as the others.

                Bonus: Since pieces are dropped from the top, how can we animate
                that? How would gravity affect a still-dropped piece?
